# Mobile-Desktop Development Session Notes

## Session Date: 2025-07-07
## Mobile Environment: Termux 0.118.1 on Android 15 (Nothing A142)

### Current Project Status Analysis

**Missing Core Files Identified:**
- `GameManager.gd` autoload (referenced in project.godot but missing)
- `AudioManager.gd` autoload (referenced in project.godot but missing)
- Scene files (.tscn) - Main.tscn referenced but not found
- Sprite assets directory (res://sprites/ likely missing)

**Existing Working Components:**
- ✅ `SpriteManager.gd` - Comprehensive sprite management system
- ✅ `StateMachine.gd` - Robust state machine implementation
- ✅ Project configuration properly set up with autoloads
- ✅ Input mapping configured for game controls
- ✅ Character data structure defined in SpriteManager

### Mobile Development Environment Status

**✅ Fully Functional:**
- Termux environment with 28GB available storage
- Python 3.12.11, Git 2.50.0, all dev tools installed
- Mobile development scripts working perfectly
- Git configured with proper user credentials

**⚠️ Limitations:**
- No MCP server access on mobile
- No Godot engine available in Termux packages
- Limited to text-based development (GDScript editing)

### Priority Development Tasks for Desktop MCP Session

#### HIGH PRIORITY (Critical Missing Components)

1. **Create GameManager.gd Autoload**
   - Game state management
   - Scene transitions
   - Player data persistence
   - Integration with existing SpriteManager and StateMachine

2. **Create AudioManager.gd Autoload**
   - Background music system
   - Sound effects management
   - Audio configuration and mixing
   - Wedding-themed audio cues

3. **Create Main Scene Structure**
   - Main.tscn (referenced as main scene)
   - Character scenes for each wedding party member
   - Environment scenes (wedding venues)
   - UI scenes (menus, HUD)

4. **Sprite Asset Creation/Placeholder System**
   - Wedding character sprites (Mark, Jenny, Glen, Quinn, Jack, Acids Joe)
   - Environment assets (wedding venue, chaos effects)
   - UI elements and icons

#### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Game Systems)

5. **Character Behavior Implementation**
   - Use StateMachine.gd for character AI
   - Implement character-specific abilities:
     - Mark: Drumstick attacks
     - Jenny: Camera bomb mechanics
     - Glen: Chaos-causing accidents
     - Quinn: Organizing/fixing abilities
     - Jack: Hipster cafe interactions
     - Acids Joe: Psychedelic boss attacks

6. **Wedding Chaos System**
   - Event triggers and consequences
   - Escalating chaos mechanics
   - Recovery/management systems
   - Win/lose conditions

7. **Dialogue System Integration**
   - Character dialogue data
   - Wedding-specific scenarios
   - Branching conversation trees
   - Integration with Dialogue Manager plugin

#### LOW PRIORITY (Polish & Enhancement)

8. **Mobile-Desktop Workflow Optimization**
   - Improve sync scripts for asset files
   - Add mobile-specific development shortcuts
   - Enhance mobile testing capabilities

9. **Documentation & Setup**
   - Game design document
   - Character behavior specifications
   - Wedding scenarios and story beats

### Technical Architecture Decisions Needed

**MCP Server Integration Questions:**
- Which MCP servers are most valuable for this project?
- How to integrate Context7 for character personality management?
- TaskMaster setup for project milestone tracking?
- Sequential thinking for complex game logic decisions?

**Game Architecture Questions:**
- Scene organization strategy (single scenes vs. composite scenes)?
- Character interaction system design?
- Save/load system requirements?
- Multiplayer considerations (local/online)?

**Asset Pipeline Questions:**
- Sprite creation workflow (AI-generated vs. hand-drawn)?
- Animation system preferences?
- Audio asset sourcing strategy?
- Asset optimization for mobile deployment?

### Development Workflow Suggestions

**Desktop MCP Session Plan:**
1. Use Context7 to research Godot 4.3 best practices
2. Use Sequential thinking to architect game systems
3. Use TaskMaster to break down development into manageable tasks
4. Use appropriate MCP servers for asset creation/sourcing

**Mobile Development Focus:**
- GDScript code editing and logic implementation
- Configuration file management
- Documentation writing
- Git workflow and version control
- Testing and debugging scripts

### Questions for Desktop Session

1. **Architecture**: Should we use a single scene with multiple states, or multiple scenes with transitions?

2. **Characters**: How complex should the AI behavior trees be? Simple state machines or full behavior trees?

3. **Wedding Chaos**: What's the core gameplay loop? Time-based pressure? Resource management? Puzzle-solving?

4. **Technical**: Should we build for mobile deployment from the start, or focus on desktop first?

5. **Assets**: AI-generated sprites vs. placeholder rectangles vs. finding free assets?

6. **Scope**: MVP feature set vs. full game features - what's the minimum viable wedding game?

### Mobile Session Contributions Made

1. ✅ Added comprehensive Gemini CLI analysis guide
2. ✅ Analyzed existing codebase architecture
3. ✅ Identified missing components and priorities
4. ✅ Tested and validated mobile development environment
5. ✅ Created detailed session notes for desktop continuity

### Next Steps

**For Desktop MCP Session:**
- Load this document and continue development
- Use MCP servers to address architecture questions
- Begin implementing missing core components
- Create development roadmap with TaskMaster

**For Mobile Development:**
- Continue with GDScript logic implementation
- Focus on character behavior and game mechanics
- Maintain documentation and session notes
- Test code changes without full Godot environment

**Note**: This document serves as a bridge between mobile and desktop development sessions, ensuring continuity and maximizing the effectiveness of both environments.
